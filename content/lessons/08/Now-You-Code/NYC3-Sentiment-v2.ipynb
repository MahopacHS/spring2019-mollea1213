Instead of using a string of words, this example will read a list of words positive and negative words from a file.\n\nIn fact, we've included two files for you so you don't have to some up with the positive and negative words! Just load the files and go! Of course if you want more positive and negative words you can always edit the files.\n\n- Positive words are in `NYC3-pos.txt`\n- Negative words are in `NYC3-neg.txt`\n\nYou will have to write a function called `LoadWords(filename)` to read the words from the file and load them into a string.\n\n## Step 1: Problem Analysis for function\n\n-Input (function arguments): `filename` to read.\n\n-Output (function returns): a `text` string of words as loaded from the file.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n```\nopen the filename for reading\n    read the entire file all at once, into text\n    return the text\n```\n",
