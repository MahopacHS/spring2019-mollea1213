Our criteria will be as follows.\n\n- Is it the weekend? Then sleep in.\n- Is it a holiday? Then sleep in.\n- Otherwise you need to get up!\n\nLet's write a program to input the day of the week and ask whether or not its a holiday, then make the appropriate decision as to whether or not we should sleep in.\n\nWe will use the **Write - Refactor - Test - Rewrite** approach to complete the final solution which will refactor the day of the week logic into a function.",

Why did we need to write 7 tests?\n\n-To test each day of the week, of which there are 7.\n\n3. Which code is easier to understand? Step 1 or step 4? Why? or Why not?\n\n-Step 4 because there is a small amount of actual code to look at yet from what's written you can infer what it does.\n\n4. What happens when you input `'sat'` for `'Saturday'` Does it work? How can the program be improved? Does improving it affect the readability of step 4? (HINT: Abstractions!!!)\n\nThis does not work because it does not match the required input, this can be fixed by using 'or' to accomodate for different spellings or capitlizations of the same words. \n",
