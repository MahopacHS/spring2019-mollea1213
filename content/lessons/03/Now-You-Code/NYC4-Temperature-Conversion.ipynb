Is this an error?\n\nThis is not an error, temperature can be negative.\n\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\n\nNo, you could just look up the reverse equation online and use that.\n\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\n\nYes,it's easier because you don't have to include the math in the print line which could get messy.\n",
