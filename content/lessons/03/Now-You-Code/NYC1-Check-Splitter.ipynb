What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\n\nYou get a ValueError in both cases\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\n\nIt is a ValueError. I think that it could be handled in code if you were to get rid of the 'float' before input.\n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \n\nThe program does run but it does not make sense because you can not have only half of a person. \n",
