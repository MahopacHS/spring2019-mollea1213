Whenever you guess, the computer will\ngive you a hint of higher or lower. This process repeats until you guess\nthe number, after which the computer reports the number of guesses it took you.\n\nFor Example:\n\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10...\nYour guess: 5\nToo low. Guess higher.\nYour guess: 7\nToo high. Guess lower.\nYour guess: 6\nYou guessed it in 3 tries.\n\nYour loop should continue until your input guess equals the\ncomputer generated random number.\n\n### How do you make Python generate a random number?

I used a while loop, which is indefinite because you don't know how long it will take the number to be guessed.\n2. Modify this program to allow you to guess a number between 1 and 100. How much of your code did you need to change to make this work? Just add another zero onto some 10's.\n3. This program is a good example of a difficult problem to conceptualize which has a simple solution when you look at actual lines of code. I assume you did not write this in a single try, so explain where you got stuck and describe your approach to overcoming it. I could not get the total amount of guesses to work so I looked at other codes for help. \n",
