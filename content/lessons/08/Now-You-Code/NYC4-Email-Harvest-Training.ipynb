This has a variety of applications the most common being buiding an email list.\nThe best way to find the emails in the mailbox file is to search for lines in the file that begin with \"From: (similar to what we did in the lab). When you find an email write just the email address (not \"From:\" and the address) to \"NYC4-emails.txt\", and don't worry about duplicates.\n\nThe program should print the number of emails it wrote to the file.\n\nExample Run:\n\n```\nWrote 27 emails to NYC4-emails.txt\n```",

Explain how this program can be improved to prompt for an email file at to process runtime?\n\n you can start the program with filename = input(filename)\n\n3. Devise an approach to remove duplicate emails from the output file. You don't have to write as code, just explain it.\n\n do an if statement for whether or not an email has already started the same way.",
