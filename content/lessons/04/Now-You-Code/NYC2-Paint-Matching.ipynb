Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases. You get a typeerror.\n2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values. You get another typeerror.\n3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example? There are two different inputs that must be correctly entered. \n4. How many times (at minimum) must we execute this program and check the results before we can be reasonably assured it is correct? Atleast 4 times. \n",
